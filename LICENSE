This is a personal research project exploring autonomous drone flight
using deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning techniques.
The project demonstrates advanced AI concepts including:

- Deep Q-Learning with experience replay
- Imitation learning from human demonstrations
- 3D physics simulation with realistic drone dynamics
- LiDAR-based obstacle detection and avoidance
- Hybrid training approaches combining multiple learning paradigms

The research focuses on developing intelligent autonomous systems
capable of learning complex navigation tasks through both
supervised learning from demonstrations and reinforcement learning
from environmental interaction.
